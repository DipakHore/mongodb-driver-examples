mongodb-driver-examples
-----------------------

Introduction at:
http://blog.mongolab.com/2011/11/ample-mongodb-examples/

This git repository includes mongodb connection and query examples
for the following:

    -Java
     http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Java+Language+Center

    -Node.js (using Mongoose)
     http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/node.JS

    -PHP
     http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/PHP+Language+Center

    -Python (using pymongo)
     http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/

    -Ruby (using the official driver from 10gen)
     http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Ruby+Language+Center

    -Ruby (using MongoMapper)
     http://mongomapper.com/documentation/

    -Ruby (using Mongoid)
     http://mongoid.org/docs.html

These examples should run outright after you install the appropriate
drivers and get a MongoDB database running on your localhost. See
http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart for guidance. If you
are using a remote database, simply replace the example URI with
your own.

Currently, we provide simple connection and query examples with
some explanation of authentication concerns. In the future, we
intend to expand these examples to include many MongoDB features,
such as:

     -Authentication
     -Replica Set Connection and Failover
     -Safe mode and Write Concern

We hope these are helpful and appreciate your feedback!

Sincerely,
The MongoLab Team
